Hello, I've been experiencing issues with my new electric vehicle, particularly when trying to use the smart navigation system. It seems to lag significantly and sometimes fails to load routes, especially when I'm in areas with lower connectivity. I also noticed that the voice command feature doesn't respond accurately to my inputs, making it difficult to set destinations or control music playback. Additionally, I'm concerned about the vehicle's energy consumption when these features are active, as it appears to drain the battery faster than expected. Could you provide detailed instructions on how to troubleshoot these problems, and let me know if there are any software updates or settings adjustments that could help optimize performance and improve the battery efficiency while using these features?,No label found.
