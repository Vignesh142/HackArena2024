- **Summarization and Sentiment Analysis**: Summarize long feedback and perform sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction.
- **FAQ Bot Integration**: Provide an FAQ bot to assist customers with common queries, reducing the workload on customer support teams.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Display insights from feedback using interactive charts for quick analysis.
- **Voice Assistance and Chatbots**: Integrate voice-based and chatbot solutions to enhance user interaction and streamline data entry.

This project helps businesses automate feedback management, gain actionable insights, and improve customer service with modern AI capabilities.
